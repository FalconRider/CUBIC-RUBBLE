# CUBIC-RUBBLE
Unity CWC Game Jam 2021 submission
--------------------------------------------------------------------

by Paul J. Gitschner June 2021

HOW TO PLAY 
Just PLOW all the BLOCKS off Flatworld then stop the clock.

Plow uses ARROW Keys. Timer counts down. Earth orbit is 60 seconds.

RED cylinder is clock stopper, hit it. - plow can't fall off Flatworld, only blocks can do that,
and it only looks easy.  If you get to 1 second you get another load of BLOCKS and another 120 seconds. Lowest end time is best. Green marker is fixed for orientation only.
It's like being a snowplow driver in Canadian winter.
---------------------------------------
HOWS IT END:
When you have cleared the deck. YOU go out and hit the RED cylinder which will stop the clock.
That's your score, try to beat it.  Lower the better. Leader board next time.
 ---------------------------------------
Using Unity 2019.4- cause I know I can get WebGL builds outta that, up to a certain level of complexity.-- which I'll be attempting to stretch with this project
Written for UNITY CWC 2021  Code jam. My first code jam.
Thank you  Mr. Winkley and J,  It's because of this Spring's series of Unity courses that I've binged and gotten this far.   
Not tryin to win just participate.

Theme : Redo a classic.
Copyright info:
I'm obviously screwing with a Rubics Cube idea. Even the name is a a tease, but different.
But these are unicolour, more like LegoBricks, only wrong shape, Rubics blocks are 3 different colours each.
And I have 27 a set, rubic has 26 plus a core. And I have multiple sets. And timer resets.
And my gameplay is inverse, you create chaos not order.
With a Plow, a tool, not your hands.

Music:  by me, using a syth keyboard and Sony Acid DAW. Did this whole  piece a few years ago. 
And now used  audacity to make a short  clip  -  that annoyingly repeats.
